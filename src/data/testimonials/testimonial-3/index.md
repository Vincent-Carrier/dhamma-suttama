title: MARIA & JAMES
testimonial: Our experience at Dhamma Suttama was profound and healing. The ancient technique of Vipassana helped us understand the nature of our minds and develop true compassion for ourselves and others. The serene environment and skilled guidance provided the perfect setting for this inner journey of self-discovery.
