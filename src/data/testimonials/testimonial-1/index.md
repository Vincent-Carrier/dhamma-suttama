title: SARAH & MICHAEL
testimonial: After completing our first 10-day Vipassana course at Dhamma Suttama, we discovered a profound sense of inner peace and clarity. The technique has transformed how we handle stress and relate to each other. The silent environment and dedicated practice created the perfect conditions for deep self-observation and growth.
