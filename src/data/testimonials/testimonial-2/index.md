title: DAVID & LISA
testimonial: The 10-day Vipassana course at Dhamma Suttama was life-changing for both of us. We learned to observe our thoughts and emotions with equanimity, which has brought more harmony to our relationship and daily lives. The peaceful environment and expert guidance created the perfect foundation for this transformative practice.
