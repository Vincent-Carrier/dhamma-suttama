This Open House at Dhamma Suttama was an inspiring gathering. Visitors from all backgrounds came together to learn about Vipassana meditation and explore the peaceful centre. The welcoming atmosphere and informative presentations created the perfect introduction to this ancient practice, with many attendees deciding to register for upcoming 10-day courses.
