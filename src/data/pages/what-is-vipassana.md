Vipassana, which means "to see things as they really are," is one of India's most ancient meditation techniques. Long lost to humanity, it was rediscovered more than 2500 years ago by Gotama the Buddha who taught it as a universal remedy for universal problems.

## The Technique

Vipassana is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation. Although springing from the teachings of the Buddha, this non-sectarian technique is open to everyone regardless of background or belief.

The technique involves:
- Observing the natural breath to calm and focus the mind
- Developing awareness of bodily sensations
- Understanding the impermanent nature of all phenomena
- Cultivating equanimity towards all experiences

## Universal Application

This meditation technique is:
- **Non-sectarian**: Open to people of all religions and backgrounds
- **Practical**: Based on direct experience rather than beliefs
- **Scientific**: A systematic method of mental training
- **Universal**: Applicable to all human beings regardless of culture or creed

## Benefits

Regular practice of Vipassana meditation leads to:
- Mental purification and emotional balance
- Increased awareness and mindfulness
- Freedom from mental suffering
- Development of wisdom and compassion
- Inner peace and happiness

## Learning Vipassana

To learn the basics of Vipassana meditation, one needs to take an introductory residential ten-day course. These courses are conducted at meditation centers worldwide and are taught free of charge, relying entirely on donations from those who have benefited from the practice.

The courses maintain the tradition as taught by S.N. Goenka, ensuring the purity and authenticity of the technique is preserved for future generations.
