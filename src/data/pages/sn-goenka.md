S.N. Goenka (1924-2013) was the principal teacher of Vipassana meditation in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin. Born in Burma (Myanmar) to Indian parents, he was a successful businessman before discovering Vipassana meditation.

## Early Life and Background

Satya Narayan Goenka was born into a Hindu family in Mandalay, Burma. He became a successful businessman but suffered from severe migraine headaches that no medical treatment could cure. This led him to seek help from Sayagyi U Ba Khin, a Burmese meditation teacher.

## Learning Vipassana

In 1955, Goenka began learning Vipassana meditation under the guidance of Sayagyi U Ba Khin. After 14 years of intensive practice, his teacher authorized him to teach the technique. U Ba Khin had learned the technique from Saya Thetgyi, who in turn had learned it from Ledi Sayadaw, maintaining an unbroken chain of teachers going back to the Buddha.
