# Meditation Courses for Children and Teenagers

Dhamma Suttama offers special meditation courses designed specifically for young people. These courses introduce children and teenagers to Anapana meditation, a simple yet powerful technique that helps develop concentration and mindfulness.

## What is Anapana?

Anapana is the practice of observing natural respiration - the breath coming in and going out of the nostrils. This technique:
- Helps develop concentration and focus
- Calms the mind and reduces stress
- Improves emotional regulation
